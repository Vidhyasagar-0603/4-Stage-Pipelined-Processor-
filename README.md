# 4-Stage-Pipelined-Processor-
The 4-stage pipelined processor executes instructions in four stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), and Write Back (WB). Each stage works simultaneously on different instructions, improving speed through parallelism. Registers between stages hold intermediate data for synchronization.
